						I grew up stuttering, shy, and sunblocked in suburban New Jersey.
						<br>
						<br>
						As a younger man, I spent ten years tackling people and not fitting well into most clothes. Distance running changed me profoundly and tore my meniscus almost entirely. A yoga studio or bike lane are the only places safe for me now.
						<br>
						<br>
						I'm instantly and automatically friends with every redheaded person I meet, pass on the street, or see on the internet. Same thing with all dogs.
						<br>
						<br>
						It's been six years in advertising and counting, less than a year writing code.
						<br>
						<br>
						Any free time between projects you’ll find me unintentionally gentrifying some charming neighborhood in the beautiful city I love and live in, San Francisco. There’s always sunscreen in my backpack if you need any.
