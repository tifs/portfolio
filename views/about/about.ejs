						I grew up stuttering, shy, and sunblocked in suburban New Jersey.
						<br>
						<br>
						As a younger man, I spent nine years tackling people and not fitting well into most clothes. After that, I started distance running and tore my meniscus months before&mdash;thus canceling&mdash;my first full marathon. A yoga studio or bike lane are the only places safe for me now.
						<br>
						<br>
						I'm instantly and automatically friends with every redheaded person I meet, pass on the street, or see on the internet. Same thing with all dogs.
						<br>
						<br>
						It's been six years in advertising and counting, less than a year writing code. Creating things with generous, talented people never gets old or boring.
						<br>
						<br>
						Any time between projects you'll find me gentrifying some charming neighborhood in the beautiful city I love and live in, San Francisco. I've always got sunscreen in my backpack if you need any.
