						I grew up stuttering, shy, and sunscreened in suburban New Jersey.
						<br>
						<br>
						As a younger man, I spent ten years putting on pads, tackling people, and fitting poorly into most clothes. Distance running changed me profoundly and almost tore my meniscus entirely. A yoga mat or bike lane are the only places safe for me now.
						<br>
						<br>
						I'm instantly and automatically friends with every redheaded person I meet, pass on the street, or see on the internet. Same thing with all dogs.
						<br>
						<br>
						It's been six plus years in advertising, about a year and a half writing code.
						<br>
						<br>
						Any time between projects you’ll find me accidentally gentrifying some charming neighborhood in the city I love and live in, San Francisco. There’s always sunblock in my backpack if you need any.
