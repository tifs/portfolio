          <p class="col-md-4 col-sm-10 col-xs-10 intro-body">Twenty years in, doing consistently remarkable work for their clients, Astro Studios took a chance to make something of their own. A few early renders became a full line of watches, launched under the name Minus 8. Their hard work and design reflect modern life on the West Coastâ€”a unique place so many new ideas have come from.</p>

            <blockquote>"The Layer watch gives the bare essentials a professional look. Its precision case is made of stacked PVD-coated stainless steel layers that create depth in the watch's face. Three-hand timing and a date window make up its simple display, while visible movement provides a view of the complexity beneath."</blockquote>
